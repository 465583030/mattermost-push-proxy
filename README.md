# Mattermost Notifications Server 

A server for proxying push notifications to iOS devices from Mattermost, [a self-hosted team communication solution](http://www.mattermost.org/). 

For organizations who want to keep internal communications behind their firewall, this server encrypts notification messages with a private key under your control before sending them to Apple's public push notification server for delivery to your iOS devices.
